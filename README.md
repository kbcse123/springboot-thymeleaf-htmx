# springboot-thymeleaf-htmx
Project to show dynamic data based voice search using htmx javascript library and thymeleaf templating engine.

For example:
After starting the project open https://localhost:8443/. 
Project is http2 and SSL enabled so open in 8443 port

Once opened, search for any user from feed by typing manually or
click the button "Activate Voice Search" and call out the user name

Let say "Lover", it will show the list of users having the occurence.
Next say "Clear / go back", the search list is replaced with default list.

we can also delete the user through voice after doing a search and saying "delete"
